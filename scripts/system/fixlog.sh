# Truncating ssh-ws.log fully would drop the [CONNECT] lines that map a live
# session's proxy-port to its real client IP, breaking the SSH monitor. So
# instead of wiping it, we keep the most recent lines (enough to cover any
# currently-live session) and only hard-wipe the bulky system logs.

# Hard-wipe high-volume logs that the monitors do not need historically.
